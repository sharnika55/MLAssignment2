# ML Assignment 2 – Classification Models

## Problem Statement
Build and evaluate multiple classification models and deploy them using Streamlit.

## Dataset Description
Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
- Instances: 569
- Features: 30 numeric features
- Target: Diagnosis (Malignant / Benign)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest (Ensemble)
- XGBoost (Ensemble)

## Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|------|----------|-----|----------|--------|----|-----|
| Logistic Regression | | | | | | |
| Decision Tree | | | | | | |
| KNN | | | | | | |
| Naive Bayes | | | | | | |
| Random Forest | | | | | | |
| XGBoost | | | | | | |

## Observations

| Model | Observation |
|------|------------|
| Logistic Regression | Stable and interpretable |
| Decision Tree | Fast but overfits |
| KNN | Sensitive to scaling |
| Naive Bayes | Simple baseline |
| Random Forest | Strong ensemble |
| XGBoost | Best overall performance |

## Deployment
Deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud.
